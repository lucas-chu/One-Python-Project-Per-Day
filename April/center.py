'''
# This implementation takes in a graph, represented as lists of vertices and edges, and fills two arrays
# (distance and predecessor) with shortest - path information
# Step 1: initialize graph for each vertex v in vertices:
    for each vertex v in vertices:
       distance[v] := inf             // At the beginning , all vertices have a weight of infinity
       predecessor[v] := null         // And a null predecessor

   distance[source] := 0              // The weight is zero at the source

   // Step 2: relax edges repeatedly
   for i from 1 to size(vertices)-1:
       for each edge (u, v) with weight w in edges:
           if distance[u] + w < distance[v]:
               distance[v] := distance[u] + w
               predecessor[v] := u

   // Step 3: check for negative-weight cycles
   for each edge (u, v) with weight w in edges:
       if distance[u] + w < distance[v]:
           error "Graph contains a negative-weight cycle"

   return distance[], predecessor[]
